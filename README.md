# Sequence Similarity Search of Nsp4 Protein (Corona Virus) Using Psi-Blast
This is my graduation final year paper. Here I used PSI-BLAST which is very powerfull tool for finding potential homologous of protein or DNA sequences.
PSI-Blast is a very powerful way to identify potential homologous that may have been missed by the first round of a BLAST search.
