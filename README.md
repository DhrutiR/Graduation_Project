# Sequence Similarity Search of Nsp4 Protein (Corona Virus) Using PSI-BLAST
- In this paper I discussed about structure of the corona virus protein and their function with diagram
- retrived the amino acid sequence of nsp4 protein using FASTA tool
- sequence similarity check against nsp4 protein using BLAST tool
- specifically I used PSI-BLAST here to find many distant members of a protein sequence family
